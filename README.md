As a food-chemist I gathered experience inside the laboratories of different analytical service providers as analytical service manager. Regularly analytical chemists might be well trained in regular affairs, but only a few have good skills in modern data processing. Often data processes are still driven by manual inputs and Excelfiles in best case with VBA-scripting, just by habit or inexperience. 

During my work in the lab I recognized, that manual data-inputs are starting to become a risk for process-quality and slowing down your process significantly. For me that was the point to start learning Python, while learning some basics of software-architectures, servers and databases.
For working together with software engineers you need a basic skill in computer science to communicate the needs well.

Right now I am now working as an analytical chemist with HPLC and mass-spectrometry in the field of water-technologies within Advanced Oxidation Processes, while building up digital tools for automated data analysis. Just to make things less manual driven in our laboratory.
