# 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Beringer
**Digital Analytical Chemist | Food & Environmental Analytics | Chemoinformatics & Data Science**

---

## 🔬 About Me
I work at the interface of **analytical chemistry, regulatory science, and data science**. During my career in food and environmental analytics, I realized that manual data handling often becomes a bottleneck and a risk for process quality.  

To tackle this, I started developing **digital tools** and expanding my skills in **Python, R, JavaScript, databases, machine learning, and chemoinformatics**.  

Currently, I work at **University of Jena** on:
- HPLC & Mass Spectrometry in water technologies  
- **QSPR/QSAR modeling** of Advanced Oxidation Processes  
- Automated pipelines for chemical data analysis  

My fascination lies in **applying data science to real-world, regulatory, and societal challenges in chemistry**.
